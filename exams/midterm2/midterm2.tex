\subquestionwithpoints{6} Is the model assumption a realistic assumption? To get full credit, you must address two distinct assumptions.\spc{7}

\problem This question continues our discussion of \qu{batting averages} in baseball.


\noindent Every hitter's \emph{sample} batting average (BA) is defined as:

\beqn
BA := \frac{\text{sample \# of hits}}{\text{sample \# of at bats}}
\eeqn

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.2in]{baseball.jpg}
\end{figure}
\noindent In class we discussed a means to infer a hitter's true batting average $\theta$ by using empirical Bayes with the binomial likelihood model where the prior we considered was $\theta \sim \betanot{\alpha = 78.7}{\beta = 224.8}$.



\benum

\subquestionwithpoints{8} Given that a new batter starts his season with $n=6$ at bats and 3 hits, find an expression for the probability he has exactly 100 hits during his next 387 at bats. \spc{6}

\eenum

\problem This question has some theoretical questions. The parts are independent from each other unless otherwise stated.

\benum

\subquestionwithpoints{4} If $\Xoneton~|~\theta \iid \text{Geometric}(\theta)$ and $\theta \sim \betanot{\alpha}{\beta}$, what is $\expe{\theta~|~\Xoneton}$? \spc{6}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} If $\Xoneton~|~\theta \iid \text{Poisson}(\theta)$ and $\theta \sim \text{Gamma}\parens{\alpha, ~\beta}$, what is the kernel of $\cprob{\theta}{\Xoneton}$? \spc{6}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Under the model in (b), what is the Jeffrey's prior? \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{6} Under the model in (b), find $\cprob{X^*}{\Xoneton}$ where $X^*$ is one future realization from the same poisson likelihood model. For the parameters of this distribution, only use notation given in (b). \spc{5}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} If $\Xoneton ~|~\theta,\sigsq \iid \normnot{\theta}{\sigsq}$ with $\sigsq$ known and the prior is $\theta ~|~\sigsq \sim \normnot{\mu_0}{\tau^2}$, what is $\cprob{\theta}{\Xoneton, \sigsq}$? \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{6} For the model in (e) reparameterize the prior using $\rho$, the quantity that indicates shrinkage to the prior expectation. \spc{7}

\subquestionwithpoints{6} [Extra Credit] If $\Xoneton ~|~\theta,\sigsq \iid \normnot{\theta}{\sigsq}$ with $\sigsq$ known and the prior is a \textit{mixture} of $K$ Gaussians e.g. $\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_K \inddist \normnot{\mu_k}{\tau^2_k}$, demonstrate that the posterior is normal and find the posterior parameters. Assume the mixture is uniform i.e., each of the $k$ mixture components has the same probabilitiy i.e. $1/K$.\spc{5}

\problem This question continues our discussion about extrasensory perception. A famous series of experiments called the Ganzfeld experiments work as follows. A human subject called the \qu{receiver} sits in a room in darkness with their eyes covered and with headphones to filter out any noise. An example subject is pictured below:

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{Ganzfeld.jpg}
\end{figure}

\noindent Another human subject called the transmitter sits in another room. In the beginning of the experiment, the transmitter is shown an image. The transmitter than tries to \qu{telephathically transmit} the image to the receiver. At the conclusion of the experiment, the receiver is shown four images --- three decoys and the true image the transmitter was given --- and is asked to choose one. If the receiver chooses the true image, this is termed a \qu{hit}.

\benum

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Under the null hypothesis of \qu{no ESP}, the receiver chooses one image randomly from four images where one image make the \qu{hit}. Create a r.v. $X$ for the \qu{hit} under the null. Indicate the type of r.v. and the value of $\theta$. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} A psychic claims that his ability to identify the target image is 50\%. Create a prior on both the null $\theta$ and the psychic's claimed $\theta$. Use the principle of indifference.\spc{1}


\subquestionwithpoints{7} We run three independent experimental trials of which the psychic gets two of the three correct. Calculate $\prob{X}$.   \spc{5}


\subquestionwithpoints{6} Find the probability that the psychic's assessment of his abilities is correct given this data. \spc{5}


\subquestionwithpoints{7} Calculate the probability the next experiment for this psychic (i.e. the fourth, unobserved experiment) will be a \qu{hit}. \spc{5}



\subquestionwithpoints{6} We now put a uniform prior on $\theta$ across all values in the support. Find the probability that this psychic has \qu{better than normal} abilities given the data. You are free to leave your answer in notation from Table~\ref{tab:eqs}. \spc{2}


\subquestionwithpoints{5} Instead of a uniform prior, you want to factor in what you've seen previously. You figure your prior experience is worth 18 trials and you haven't seen any evidence of ESP in those trials. Using the conjugate prior we discussed in class, what is the prior for $\theta$ now? \spc{1}

\subquestionwithpoints{7} Illustrate this prior the best you can. No need for perfect scale. Make sure to label axes appropriately. \spc{10}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Compute the prior mean. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Given this prior and the data, calculate the shrinkage proportion towards $\expe{\theta}$ if you were to use $\thetahatmmse$ for your point estimation strategy. \spc{1}


\subquestionwithpoints{5} If there was a lot of data, what would be the influence of the prior on the point estimate of $\theta$? Try to use only one word. \spc{0}

\subquestionwithpoints{6} Given this prior and the data, fill in the following boxes with only the following symbols: $<, ~\leq, ~>, ~\geq, ~=$ to indicate the numerical relationships.\vspace{-0.4cm}

\beqn
\thetahatmap~~\framebox(20,20){}~~ \thetahatmmse, \quad \thetahatmae~~\framebox(20,20){}~~ \thetahatmmse, \quad \thetahatmap~~\framebox(20,20){}~~ \thetahatmae
\eeqn

\subquestionwithpoints{10} In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008 amassing data on 1,498 trials with different receiver and transmitter subjects. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 were hits. Test the existence of ESP in the Ganzfeld experiments using the Frequentist (i.e. the \textit{non-Bayesian}) two-sided test. You must (1) write your hypotheses clearly, (2) choose your own significance level and (3) state clearly the conclusion of the test.\spc{7}


\subquestionwithpoints{4} Using the Storm et al. (2010) Ganzfeld data and a uniform prior, create a 95\% credible region for $\theta$. You are free to leave your answer in notation from Table~\ref{tab:eqs}. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Describe in one sentence how you would use the answer from the previous question to test the existence of ESP in the Storm et al. (2010) Ganzfeld data using one of the Bayesian two-sided hypothesis test strategies discussed in class.\spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{10} Assess the evidence for the ESP phenomenon in the Ganzfeld experiments using Bayes Factors. You will not be able to solve for $B$ numerically but you need to get as far as you can. 5 points extra credit if you can solve numerically and interpret your result. You can use $\natlog{n!} \approx n\natlog{n} - n + 1$. \spc{8}


\eenum

\problem This is a theoretical question.

\benum
\subquestionwithpoints{5} Consider the case of assessing the evidence of $\theta_a$ versus $\theta_0$. Show that $B$ is the odds ratio of the posterior odds to the prior odds.

\problem This question is ironically about theory of testing.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{examination.jpg}
\end{figure}

\noindent Every hitter's \emph{sample} batting average (BA) is defined as:

\beqn
BA := \frac{\text{sample \# of hits}}{\text{sample \# of at bats}}
\eeqn

In this problem we care about estimating a hitter's \emph{true} batting average which we call $\theta$. Each player has a different $\theta$ but we focus in this problem on one specific player. In order to estimate the player's true batting average, we use the sample batting average as defined above. 

\benum
\subquestionwithpoints{2} For the remainder of the problem, we assume that each at bat (for any player) are \emph{conditionally} $\iid$ based on the players' true batting average, $\theta$. So if a player has $n$ at bats, then each successful hit in each at bat can be modeled via

\beqn
X_1~|~\theta, ~X_2~|~\theta, \ldots, ~X_n~|~\theta \iid \bernoulli{\theta}.
\eeqn

Under this model above, if the player had $n=4$ at bats, would the $\prob{X_3,X_2,X_4,X_1}$ be equal to the $\prob{X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4}$? Yes / no. \spc{1}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} If the player had $n=4$ at bats and $\sum_{i=0}^n x_i=0$ hits, compute $\thetahatmle$.\spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Compute a frequentist confidence interval for $\theta$ given the data in (b).\spc{2}


\subquestionwithpoints{3} Describe in English the main problem with the interval in (c).\spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Set the following prior: $\theta \sim \stduniform$. Is this an informative prior for the true batting average? Yes/no \spc{1}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Given the prior in (e) and the data in (b), find the posterior distribution of this player's true batting average.\spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} Based on your posterior distribution in (f), give your best estimate to the value of $\theta$ which minimizes squared error loss.\spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Based on your posterior distribution in (f), describe using an integral or \texttt{R}-language expression your best estimate to the value of $\theta$ which minimizes absolute error loss but do not compute.\spc{4}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Based on your posterior distribution in (f), give your best estimate to the value of $\theta$ using the posterior mode.\spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Find an integral expression for the probability this hitter bats above a 300 batting average (which means the true batting average is 0.3 or greater). Do not compute. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Assuming you have access to \texttt{R} and its function \texttt{qbeta}, give the 95\% credible region for $\theta$. The three arguments for \texttt{qbeta} are (1) quantile (2) alpha and (3) beta. Then, provide an interpretation for this interval. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} What would the Jeffrey's prior be in our model situation described in (a)? \spc{1}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Would the posterior under the Haldane prior be proper given the data in (b)? Yes / No. \spc{0.5}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} The batting average is \textit{only} measured as the batting average and never logged or transformed. Would there be any value in using the Jeffrey's prior instead of the prior in (e)? Discuss. \spc{5}


\subquestionwithpoints{5} Looking at the entire dataset for 6,061 batters who had 100 or more at bats, I fit a beta function to the sample batting averages and estimated $\alpha = 42.3$ and $\beta = 127.7$ (which we called \qu{empirical Bayes} estimates in class). Consider building a prior from this estimate as

\beqn
\theta \sim \betanot{42.3}{127.7}.
\eeqn

Would a prior based on these hyperparameter estimates be \qu{objective}? Yes / No. Why? \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Is the prior from (o) considered a \qu{conjugate prior}? Yes / No.\spc{0.5}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} Using the prior from (o), find the $\thetahatmmse$ without considering the data whatsoever. Round to 3 digits. \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Using the prior from (o) and the data from (b), find the posterior $\thetahatmmse$. Round to 3 digits. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} The posterior estimate from (q) is different from the frequentist estimate in (b) due to shrinkage. What is the proportion of shrinkage for the posterior estimate in (q)? We denoted this as $\rho$ in class. Round to 3 digits. \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} [Extra Credit] Using the Bayesian CLT, compute a 95\% credible region for $\theta$ for the data in (b) and the prior in (o). Round to 3 digits. \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} Based on the data in (b) and the prior in (o), what is the probability this batter gets a hit on his next at bat? \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Based on the data in (b) and the prior in (o), write an exact expression for the batter getting 14 or more hits on the next 20 at bats. You can leave your answer in terms of the beta function. Do not compute explicitly. \spc{5}

\subquestionwithpoints{6} Based on the data in (b) and the prior in (o), find the kernel of the distribution for the number of hits this batter gets in the next $m$ at bats. Partial credit is given. \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Based on the data in (b) and the prior in (o), the joint posterior predictive distribution for $n=4$ looks like as follows. 

%library(VGAM)
%barplot(dbetabinom.ab(0 : 4, 4, shape1 = 42.3 + 0, shape2 = 127.7 + 4), names = 0 : 4, xlab = "X* (# hits)", ylab = "prob(X*|X)")
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{post_pred.pdf}
\end{figure}

Does the data from (b) look abnormal for this model? Yes / no. \spc{0.5}

\subquestionwithpoints{7} Test the following hypotheses by finding an integral or \texttt{R}-language expression for the Bayesian $p$-val for the data in (b) and prior in (o):

\beqn
&& H_0: \theta \geq \theta_0 \\
&& H_a: \theta < \theta_0
\eeqn

where $\theta_0 = \expe{\theta}$. That is, we're testing if this batter is truly \qu{below-average} as compared to the 6,061 career major league baseball players from the official dataset.\spc{8}

\subquestionwithpoints{7} Write an integral or \texttt{R}-language expression for $K$, the Bayes Factor in favor of $H_a$.\spc{9}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} For the model in (a), specify $\mathcal{F}$ (the likelihood model) of a hit at a single at bat. \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} [Extra credit] For the the data in (b) and prior in (o), compute $\expesub{X}{\cexpesub{\theta}{\theta}{X}}$ using the Law of Iterated Expectation. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} [Extra credit] For the data in (b), what is the frequentist predictive distribution?
